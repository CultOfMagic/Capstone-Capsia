Admin Side Functions:

Items/Accounts Panel (Functional): What we did here is implement the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. This is where items in the inventory system are added and updated. The admin can manage these items (Non-Consumable/Consumable). Similarly, for accounts, the admin creates user accounts when they fill out a registration form in the admin office.

Request from the User Panel (Semi-Functional): This section displays user requests, such as requests to borrow an Item, request a New Item, or return an Item. It also displays which user made the request and includes buttons on the side for "Approve," "Reject," and "View Details." When the admin approves or rejects an item, a popup shows the status. The details display the specifics of the item.

Report Panel (Semi-Functional): This panel displays reports of items requested by users. It also includes downloadable files in formats like PDF, Word, or Excel.

User Side Functions:

Request of the User Panel (Semi-Functional): This section is the request form where users can submit their requestsâ€”for example, Borrow an Item, Request a New Item, or Return an Item. These requests should be visible to the admin for verification to ensure they are valid.

User Transaction History Panel (Semi-Functional): This section contains the user's transaction history, which is viewable. It shows all their previous requests. Users can click on specific transactions to open a modal popup with the request details.

Inventory Table Viewing (Functional): In this part, the Users can now view the inventory table, where they can see a list of available items. This functionality enables users to browse through the current inventory to check item availability before making requests.
